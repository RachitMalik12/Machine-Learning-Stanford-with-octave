# About this Repository
These are my solutions to the assignments in the Coursera online course taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford University on Machine Learning 
I am having a blast learning about Machine learning during this quarantine.. 
Please note if you are doing the course to not copy the code directly in the repository and only use it as a reference after you have
tried completing the assignment on your own!
